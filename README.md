# Laser-Security-Alarm-with-Email-Notification-Feature
I have developed this prototype laser security alarm with the ESP32 Dev Module that starts a buzzer alarm and sends an email notification to your email.
You can see the wifi connection status, email sending status etc. on the OLED display connected to it and can use the up, down, left, right and select button to enter a new wifi credential using a virtual keyboard on the OLED display if you want to connect to a different wifi network that is not the default wifi network declared in the code, this way you won't have to reupload the code every time you need to connect to a new wifi network.
